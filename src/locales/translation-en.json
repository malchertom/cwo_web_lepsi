It is a standard contest for individual competitors, both women and men, divided into standard weight categories according to IWF and ČSV rules. A special feature of the CWO is the TEAM category, where each team consists of 4 members (men, women, or mixed). Both individuals and teams are welcome, including beginners, advanced and experienced competitors, as well as strength sports enthusiasts of all age groups.",
